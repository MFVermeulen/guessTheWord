# guessTheWord

This is the code for a simple "guess the word" game in JS.

You can see how it works here: sourceserver.net/blog/game/

The game also has a 'hint' function, which randomly adds a hint letter to the word.

PS: Yes, I know it doesn't make much sense to run this client side since a smart person could find the list of words in the JS file. :)
